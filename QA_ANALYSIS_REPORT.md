---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

### **1. tRPC Usage Pattern Issues** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Incorrect tRPC query/mutation usage patterns
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Missing proper query/mutation distinction
const hiMutation = trpc.example.hi.useMutation() // Used for data fetching

// ✅ FIXED - Now properly separated
const hiQuery = trpc.example.hiQuery.useQuery() // For data fetching
const hiMutation = trpc.example.hiMutation.useMutation() // For data modification
```

**Impact**: Could cause runtime errors and incorrect caching behavior
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added proper query/mutation separation

### **2. Search Context Backend Integration** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Mixed local/backend search logic causing confusion
- Uses tRPC for backend search but also has local filtering
- Inconsistent state management between local and remote results
- Type casting issues with search results

**Status**: ✅ **PARTIALLY FIXED** - Improved type safety and error handling

### **3. Type Safety Issues** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Problems Found**:
- Unsafe type casting: `searchQuery_tRPC.data as SearchResult[]`
- Missing proper error handling types
- Inconsistent return types in some backend routes

**Status**: ✅ **IMPROVED** - Added proper type mapping and validation

### **4. Error Handling Gaps** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Problems**:
- Some tRPC calls lack proper error boundaries
- Toast notifications not consistently implemented
- Network failures not always handled gracefully

**Status**: ✅ **IMPROVED** - Enhanced error handling in search context

---

## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Backend Route Improvements**
- ✅ Added both query and mutation versions of hi route for flexibility
- ✅ Updated app router to expose both endpoints
- ✅ Fixed admin dashboard to use proper query endpoint

### **2. Search Context Enhancements**
- ✅ Improved error handling with proper useEffect patterns
- ✅ Enhanced type safety with proper result mapping
- ✅ Better separation of concerns between local and remote search

### **3. Type Safety Improvements**
- ✅ Removed unsafe type casting
- ✅ Added proper type validation and mapping
- ✅ Enhanced error type handling

---

## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES TO ADDRESS**

### **1. Web Compatibility Concerns** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Issues**:
- Some Expo APIs have limited web support (haptics, camera features)
- React Native Reanimated has web limitations
- Need proper Platform.OS checks for web-specific fallbacks

**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive web compatibility layer

### **2. Performance Optimization** 🟡 **LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Areas for Improvement**:
- Large component re-renders in home screen
- Search debouncing could be optimized
- Image loading optimization needed
- Memory leak potential in some useEffect hooks

### **3. Testing Coverage** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Missing**:
- Unit tests for critical business logic
- Integration tests for tRPC endpoints
- E2E tests for core user flows
- Performance testing for large datasets

### **4. Security Considerations** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Areas to Review**:
- API endpoint authentication
- User data validation
- Secure storage implementation
- Rate limiting on search endpoints
